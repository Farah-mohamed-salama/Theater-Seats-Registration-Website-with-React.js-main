# Theatre Booking System

A theatre booking system is a project that allows users to check for available seats  
in the theatre and book them at the same time. It solves the problem where people  
go for a movie and find the theatre houseful, causing disappointment. This project  
automates the manual booking system online, so users can make prior bookings for  
desired seats for their preferred show at the desired time and cost.

The system also provides optional extras like food packages and discounts. It calculates  
all associated charges for tickets and items, making it an advanced booking system  
that allows users to customize their show experience according to their needs.

## Modules

- **Admin Login:**  
  The admin controls all system functions, can update theatre information, and make modifications.

- **User Login/Registration:**  
  Users must register and create an account to view theatre details and book seats.

- **Seat Availability Check:**  
  The system continuously checks seat status and uses colors to indicate availability.  
  Booked seats are marked yellow, and available seats are marked grey.

- **Seat Booking Online for Date and Time:**  
  Users can view and book seats according to date and time slots.

- **Additional Facilities:**  
  Users can opt to book additional items such as food packages.

- **Automatic Cost Calculation:**  
  The system calculates the total amount for all booked items and generates an online bill.

- **Seat Cancellation:**  
  Users can cancel previous bookings and make new reservations.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.  
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.)  
right into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work,  
but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments,  
and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't  
customize it when you are ready for it.
